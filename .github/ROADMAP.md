# Roadmap
_**Jandig - Free and open AR experiences**_

We work with artists, curators and developers to build an accessible AR community for enthusiasts. So that art consumers can perceive AR as a way to produce art. In open-source, to get good solution you need to get many people involved. We are working open to get diverse perspectives, contributors and form a healthy community, not a closed product.
