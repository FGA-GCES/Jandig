# 4. Product overview

## 4.1 Product perspective

The Jandig ARte project aims to bring about a new way of artcrafting, by means of using Augmented Reality technology as a displaying method, one that can be interacted with, with some limitations.

By enabling artists to create AR pieces, Jandig paves way for art to be less restricted to physical exhibitions and/or museuns, but at the same time not excluding any of them. Jandig pieces can be attached to many surfaces, in which the user can simply open its website and read the specific piece to be able to see more of its contents.

Jandig also enable users to create their own artworks and exhibitions, following the same methods that professional artists use to create their artworks on this platform. By doing so, art can become a subject that is less tied to professional artists, and more to the non-professional public.

## 4.2 Capabilities summary

| Benefits to the user | Support features |
| - | - |
| Ease of creating jandig-directed artworks | The application allows users and artists to create their art by simply providing an image and a .gif of the desired piece. The system will then provide the steps and other files and configurations that are required to create artworks and exhibitions |
| Ease of viewing and interacting with exhibitions | For the system to work and for the public to be able to use it, a smartphone with internet access and a camera are required. The user will connect to the platform through its specific URL and will be prompted by a page that asks to fire up the camera. By doing so and by selecting the exhibition that is tied to the artwork, users can then see through their smartphones camera the .gif that is played in a loop.| 

## 4.3 Assumptions and dependencies

- The user needs to have access to a smartphone with a built-in camera and internet access.

- The responsive web app will be utilized by people that desire to AR view artworks that were made within the app requirements.
