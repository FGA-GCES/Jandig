### scope 
  This document is extremely important for understanding the project as a whole, since architecture is the basis of all software. It is not only suitable for people who want to contribute to the project, but also so that the current team can remember and even change previous architectural decisions.

### Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **SAD:** Software Architecture Document
- **App** : Application
- **MTV:** Model-Template-View
- **PWA:** Progressive Web App

### Overview
  ...  


## Architectural Representation

Project's main programming language is Python, through Django framework. Django uses an exclusive architecture called **MTV (Model-Template-View)**, in which **Model** represents the data layer, **Template** represents user's interface and **View** acts as an intermediary layer between them:

Jandig ARte is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, which means it is an web app that has a similar use to a native mobile app. It uses **PostgreSQL** as database.


## Use-Case View
### Account Access and Management

The diagram below shows how account access and management is done, with users and system as actors. Please note that Visitor is an user that hasn't log in the app.
