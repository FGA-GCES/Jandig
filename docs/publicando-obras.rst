Como publicar conteúdo em realidade aumentada no Jandig
=======================================================

1) Acesse "https://jandig.app/generator". Faça upload da imagem a
   ser utilizada no Marcador sem a borda preta (ela será adicionada pelo
   aplicativo). Baixe o Marcador (Download .PATT Marker) e a imagem
   (Download image Marker) e guarde os arquivos em um local seguro. Se
   quiser, baixe PDFs com os marcadores para impressão. Importante:
   colocar o Patern Ratio como 0.60.

2) Acesse "http://jandig.art" e crie uma conta.

3) Clique em "Enviar Marcador" e suba a imagem (com extensão ".PNG") e
   marcador (".PATT") criadas na etapa anterior. Esta imagem é a que a
   câmera do Jandig reconhecerá.

4) Clique em "Enviar Objeto" e faça upload do GIF com a sua animação.
   Esta imagem o Jandig exibirá sobre a da câmera.

5) Clique em "Criar Obra jandig", escolha o Marcador e Objeto
   correspondente que você acabou de subir. Uma OBRA é o conjunto do
   Marcador e Objeto, vinculando para ser apresentado em realidade
   aumentada.

6) Clique em "Criar Exposição". Escolha uma ou várias obras. Dê um
   título para o conjunto e defina sua URL. Ela será usada para acessar
   o conjunto de Obras criado por você. Por exemplo, se você inserir
   "expoteste" a URL definitiva para acessar sua(s) criações será
   "https://jandig.app/expoteste".

Acesse a URL definitiva que você acabou de criar, aponte a câmera para
o Marcador e veja a mágica acontecer!


Welcome to Jandig ARte!

For the newcomer artists and users, we would like to express our gratitude for having chose this platform as a tool for exhibiting your artworks.

In this manual we will guide you, step-by-step, on how to create your own Augmented Reality based art pieces. We will also explain how the system works in a meaningful way, with some core concepts, so that you will know all the steps to be taken and how they affect your art. Concepts such as markers, objects, how they corelate to create an artwork and an exhibition.

Let's get right to it, for this is a quick and essential read for those who want to use Jandig as their main AR art creator.

First steps
===========

Before anything else, an account need to be created, so that artists can deploy their pieces. It is not needed for those who only desire to appreciate an artwork, but for those who want to actively work with art, it is essential.

To do that, please refer to the steps below.

1) Access Jandig's website by clicking in the appropriate `URL`_, and click the "Sign up" button.

Creating your first artwork
===========================

So now the next step would be to produce (and publish) your very first artwork. To do that, there are a few concepts to go through before you can start.

Let's take a look at them.

Markers
-------

Markers are the very basis of your future artwork. They are essentially an image, made by you, or not, that is processed so that it can be succesfully read by Jandig and present your artwork. 

They caracteristically have a black border that is inserted around the drawing, and this border serves as the "marker", or signal, that Jandig recognizes and fires up its system. 

To create a marker, all you need to have with you is your image. It can be anything, from a painting to a random picture you saved from google images (but be aware that most of the times these images will be scanned by your smartphone's camera, so it is advised that your image is not too big or have too many small details that will not be able to be enjoyed through the camera). Jandig will do all the work of processing and generating your marker.

To do that, head to this `page`_, and submit your image for marker generation. Take a look at the imagem down below to see what it looks like, and where to upload your image.

Ok, so now that you have uploaded your image, go ahead and download the two files that will be given to you by Jandig, the .patt marker file and the image marker file. For the sake of brevity and simpicity of this manual, the pattern file (.patt) is the file created and used by most AR toolkits as the pattern the AR technology will recognize.

Store these two files in a safe location, for safekeeping.

Now all you have to do is upload the file! Go back to the application's `main`_ page and select the button that says "Upload Marker". You will be greeted by this screen.

.. _main: https://jandig.app

   Marker upload page
   
This is where you will submit your marker, so go ahead and fill the spaces with information like title and author's name, in case you're not the marker's creator, as well as choosing from your computer the appropriate marker image (that .png file from before) and the marker pattern (that .patt file from before). Don't forget to read all the informations the page contain.

Voila! You have succesfully created and added to your collection an AR marker. For the next step, we will be creating an object!

Objects
-------

When you upload a marker, the application will re-direct you to the main page again. From there, look for the button that says "Upload Object", which is right below the "Upload Marker" button. Go ahead and click it, and the application will lead you to this `page`_ right here.

.. figure: ..docs/images/upload-object.png
   :scale: 50%
   
   Object upload page
 
In this page, you will submit your object. In Jandig terms, the object is the animation that will show up in your screen when you read the marker throgh your device's camera. It is the real magic of AR and the one which all the work before will be useful for. So let's take a look at the page and learn how to upload a marker.

While this submission form is bigger, the process is much simpler. Before filling it out, take your time to select and locate the .gif that you will want to upload. There is no restriction on the application regarding the GIF type, size, theme, looping and whatnot. But the Jandig creators recommend that you choose a GIF that has a perfect loop and is on par with the marker's thematic. Also, don't feel restricted to using a gif that you have found on the internet or social media. Go ahead and use all your artistic skills to create your own! 

Now is the time to keep in mind that scale and position of the object will affect the artwork. There are two fiels where you can fill with numbers related to those two parameters:

1) The scale parameter, which is set by default to 1. If you want your image to be bigger, say twice the size, just change this number to 2. If you want it to be three times it's original size, set it to 3, and so on for other sizes. This also applies for smaller sizes and decimals, such as 0.5 will be half the original objects size.
2) The position parameter, which should be adjusted relative to the size of the object on the screen. This one is further broke down into another two different parameters, horizontal and vertical. These two parameters can be better understood taking in consideration a graph. Their default values will be set to 0, which marks the center of the graph, where the horizontal and vertical lines intersect. Let's take a look at how to tamper with them:
   a) Horizontal: If the value is positive and is 2, for example, the center of the object will be placed in a distance 2 times the size of it's marker side to the right. If this value is negative, say -2, it will be placed at the same distance 2 times the size of it's marker side to the left.
   b) Vertical: If the value is positive and is 2, for example, the center of the object will be placed in a distance 2 times the size of it's marker side, above it. If this value is negative, say -2, it will be placed at the same distance 2 times the size of it's marker side, below it.
   
After you have succesfully uploaded your image, and set your values, don't forget to give it a title and say whether you're its author or not. 

Voila! You have succesfully created your markers object and can now create your artwork! Remember that these two, marker and object, are not yet linked to one another. This will happen in the next step.
